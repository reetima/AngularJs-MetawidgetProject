# AngularJs-MetawidgetProject


Metawidget is a smart User Interface widget that populates itself, either statically or at runtime, with UI components to match the properties of your domain objects.
 
This example include a single page UI by using AngulaJs and Metawidget to collect some data, and  saved in to the console. Also tried collecting data in a nested structure.
